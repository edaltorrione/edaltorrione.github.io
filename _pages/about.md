Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Biostatistics at the Yale School of Public Health, working with Prof. Laura Forastiere. My research focuses on developing methodologies for causal inference and policy evaluation, especially in settings involving clustered and network data. Currently, I am developing estimation methods for optimal treatment allocation strategies with interference among individuals.

Prior to joining Yale, I obtained my PhD in Economics and Finance in September 2024 from the University of Rome Tor Vergata, under the supervision of Prof. Tiziano Arduini.
